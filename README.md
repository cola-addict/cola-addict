## ‣ About me ! ; :fish_cake:

➞: You can call me Amane Yugi or Hanako kun , But if we ever get to a deep point of friendship , call me by my real name! (I would never mind that ^^) ˗ˏˋ✩ˎˊ˗

➞: (You , Probably): “But , Hanako , I wonder how old you are?!” , Woah woah , there there my friend , i thought i made it clear by saying in my bio that i AM a minor , why should i reveal my age?! not on the internet. ˗ˏˋ✩ˎˊ˗

➞: Interests: Well , actually 🤓 I do have a lot of these , I draw and sketch in my spare time , listen to music , read booklets with various different information , watch some TV shows , go for a walk outside from time to time , handcraft something to decorate my room walls , pull some horrible pranks on my close ones (I love you guys , don’t hold a grudge against me for that- <3) , and making some new skins in pony town! ˗ˏˋ✩ˎˊ˗

➞: Just as I mentioned in my bio , I have several traumas due to my low self-esteem and I am socially awkward around people in real life , (so don’t be a pig-faced jerk and say “Oh you’re so worthless.”) , So take it easy with me , I am a bit fragile and can take things wrong , so you have to be precise in what you describe or say to me so I don’t get it wrong. ˗ˏˋ✩ˎˊ˗

## ‣ Note(s) ! ; :red_envelope:

➞: Do not copy my skins please , i worked really hard on them , And I’m sorry about that , but I’m going to have to call you out and expose you on public.. ˗ˏˋ✩ˎˊ˗

➞: However , If you ask me nicely if you can take inspiration from me , maybe I might let you! ˗ˏˋ✩ˎˊ˗

➞: I don’t intentionally ignore others , but if I did , I’d most likely be AFK at the time. ˗ˏˋ✩ˎˊ˗

➞: Whenever you see my status in Do Not Disturb mode , do not disturb. ˗ˏˋ✩ˎˊ˗

## ‣ DNI (Do Not Interact) list , (and WHY.) ! ; :no_entry_sign:

➞: Copycats: 🤡 They have no independence , just empty minds and a huge waste of time. ˗ˏˋ✩ˎˊ˗

➞: P̷e̷d̷o̷s̷: 🤮 Do I even have to explain this shit??!! ˗ˏˋ✩ˎˊ˗

➞: Age fakers: 🥸 They think they’ll just “blend” and “fit in”. :skull:.. Grow up , get mature , and get yourself a job. ˗ˏˋ✩ˎˊ˗

➞: Manipulators , dramatists , guilt trippers , rude people , liars , backstabbers: 😬 Well , you figured it out , they’re all came from the same school , the worst class to ever walk the earth. ˗ˏˋ✩ˎˊ˗

➞: Racists: 😐 If I were you, I would wish I was actually dead. ˗ˏˋ✩ˎˊ˗

➞: Homophobic people: 🙄 Would it hurt you to death respecting other people’s love life choices?!! Jeez , so fusty. ˗ˏˋ✩ˎˊ˗

➞: People over 18 yo: :x: Yes. Unless i’ve known you sooner. Then , it’d be fine by me! ˗ˏˋ✩ˎˊ˗

## ‣ Farewell ! ; 🩷

➥ (phew~) Well , with all that said , I think I’ve covered most of the points / opinions (so far?) , 
This post may be updated later in the future , I’m not quite sure yet , but that’s all , thank you all! (^3^) <3 ˗ˏˋ✩ˎˊ˗
